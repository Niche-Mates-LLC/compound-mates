description: Deep exploration and research before acting - Alberto's most-used prompt

NEVER EVER act BLIND — do OBSERVING. In engineering, observation precedes planning and everything else (OBSERVATION >>> ASSUMPTION). Do your pesquisas. Do proper reconnaissance: explore the repo, read, navigate, traverse, trace flows, map dependencies and contracts. Seek for external information (WebSearch, Fetch, check documentation...). Only then craft the pesquisas. You can use 1-to-12 Explore Agents; plus do pesquisas yourself.
