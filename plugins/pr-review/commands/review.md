# PR Review

Review this PR focusing on:

1. **Bugs and Logic Errors** - Will this code work correctly? Edge cases?
2. **Security Issues** - Any vulnerabilities introduced?
3. **Breaking Changes** - Does this break existing functionality?
4. **Performance** - Any obvious performance problems?

Do NOT flag:
- Style preferences (formatting, naming conventions unless confusing)
- Minor refactoring opportunities
- "Nice to haves"

Be concise. Only flag things that actually matter.
