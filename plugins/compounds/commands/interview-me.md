Read what I provide $1 and Ultraexplore (use 1-to-12 Explore Agents; plus do your own research).

Interview me in detail using AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything:
motivations, goals, constraints, assumptions, risks, tradeoffs, priorities, context,
stakeholders, success criteria, edge cases, dependencies, alternatives, urgency,
resources, open questions, mental models, first principles, hidden complexity,
contradictions, blind spots, second-order effects, failure modes, reversibility,
optionality, scope boundaries, non-goals, anti-patterns, inspirations, analogies,
emotional undertones, implicit expectations, or anything else that surfaces.

Make sure the questions are not obvious.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me until we've exhausted the topic.
